# Physical Activity Questions (See app [https://minnier.shinyapps.io/nhanes_explore_physactive/](https://minnier.shinyapps.io/nhanes_explore_physactive/) or [https://kcvi.shinyapps.io/nhanes_explore/](https://kcvi.shinyapps.io/nhanes_explore/))

1. What is the percent missing for `PhysActive` (yes/no physically active)?
2. What are the characteristics of people who have missing responses for `PhysActive`?
3. How does missingness and responses in `PhysActive` relate to responses and missingness in `PhysActiveDays` and PhysActiveDaysAtLeast3? How does the proportion of missingness in `PhysActiveDaysAtLeast3` (yes = `PhysActiveDays`>= 3, no < 3) relate to `PhysActive` response? Is this what you would expect?
4. Is there something strange about `Age`?
5. What is the median and interquartile range of `PhysActiveDays`?
6. Is number of sleep hours associated with physical activity? Consider using the categorized variable `SleepHrsNightCat`.
7. What about levels of education?
8. What about BMI? Is the association of BMI with physical activity dependent on which measure of activity you use -- `PhysActive` (yes/no) or `PhysActiveDaysAtLeast3`?
9. Are there other covariates you expect to be associated with physical activity? How do they relate to each other?
